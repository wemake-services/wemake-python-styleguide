Constants with default values for configuration.

We try to stick to "the magical 7 Â± 2 number".
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two

What does it mean? It means that we choose these values based on our mind
capacity. And it is really hard to keep in mind more that 9 objects
at the same time.

These values can be changed in the `setup.cfg` file, if you find them
too strict or too permissive.
