Writing new plugin
------------------

First of all, you have to decide:

1. Are you writing a separate plugin and adding it as a dependency?
2. Are you writing an built-in extension to this styleguide?

How to make a decision?

Will this plugin be useful to other developers without this styleguide?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If so, it would be wise to create a separate ``flake8`` plugin.
Then you can add newly created plugin as a dependency.
Our rules do not make any sense without each other.

Real world examples:

- `flake8-eradicate <https://github.com/sobolevn/flake8-eradicate>`_

Can this plugin be used with the existing checker?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``flake8`` has a very strict API about plugins.
Here are some problems that you may encounter:

- Some plugins are called once per file, some are called once per line
- Plugins should define clear ``violation code`` / ``checker`` relation
- It is impossible to use the same letter violation codes for several checkers

Real world examples:

- `flake8-broken-line <https://github.com/sobolevn/flake8-broken-line>`_

Writing new visitor
-------------------

If you are still willing to write a builtin extension to our styleguide,
you will have to write a :ref:`violation <violations>`
and/or :ref:`visitor <visitors>`.
