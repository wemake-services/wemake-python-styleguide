"""
This module contains knowledge about the most important types that we use.

There are also different :term:`visitor` specific types
that are defined and use exclusively in that file.

Policy
~~~~~~

If any of the following statements is true, move the type to this file:

- if type is used in multiple files
- if type is complex enough it has to be documented
- if type is very important for the public API

final
~~~~~

As you can see in the source code almost everything
is marked as ``@final`` or ``Final``.

It means that this value cannot be subclassed or reassigned.
This it only a ``mypy`` feature, it does not affect ``python`` runtime.

We do this, because we value composition over inheritance.
And this ``@final`` decorators help you to define readable and clear APIs
for cases when inheritance is used.

See also:
    My guide about ``@final`` type in ``python``:

    Provides structure for the options we use in our checker and visitors.

    Then this protocol is passed to each individual visitor.
    It uses structural sub-typing, and does not represent any kind of a real
    class or structure.

    We use ``@property`` decorator here instead of regular attributes,
    because we need to explicitly mark these atrtibutes as read-only.
