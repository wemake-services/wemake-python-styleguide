This module contains custom ``mypy`` types that we commonly use.

Policy
------

If any of the following statements is true, move the type to this file:

- if type is used in multiple files
- if type is complex enough it has to be documented
- if type is very important for the public API

    Provides structure for the options we use in our checker.

    Then this protocol is passed to each individual visitor and used there.
    It uses structural sub-typing, and does not represent any kind of a real
    class or structure.

    This class actually works only when running type check.
    At other cases it is just an ``object``.
