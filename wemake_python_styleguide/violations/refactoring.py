    Forbid ``else`` without ``break`` in a loop.

    We use the same logic for ``for`` and ``while`` loops.

    Reasoning:
        When there's no ``break`` keyword in loop's body it means
        that ``else`` will always be called.
        This rule will reduce complexity, improve readability,
        and protect from possible errors.

    Solution:
        Refactor your ``else`` case logic to be inside the loop's body.
        Or right after it.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        for letter in 'abc':
            if letter == 'b':
                break

    However, we allow to use ``try`` with just ``finally`` block

    It might be ``@contextmanager`` or similar thing that requires this API.

    Reasoning:
        This rule will reduce complexity and improve readability.

    Solution:
        Refactor your ``try`` logic.
        Replace the ``try-finally`` statement with a ``with`` statement.

    Forbid simplifiable ``if`` conditions.

    Reasoning:
        These complex constructions can cause frustration among other
        developers. They are longer, more verbose, and more complex.

    Solution:
        Either use ``bool()`` to convert test values to boolean values, or just
        leave it as it is in case your test already returns a boolean value.
        Use can also use ``not`` keyword to switch boolean values.

    We check single ``if`` statements that all contain
    ``return`` or ``raise`` or ``break`` statements with this rule.
    We do not check ``if`` statements with ``elif`` cases.

    Reasoning:
        Using extra ``else`` creates a situation when
        the whole node could and should be dropped
        without any changes in logic.
        So, we prefer to have less code than more code.

    1. the ``try`` block itself
    2. all ``except`` cases
    3. ``else`` case
    4. and ``finally`` case

    Reasoning:
        Nesting ``try`` blocks indicates
        that something really bad happens to your logic.
        Why does it require two separate exception handlers?
        It is a perfect case to refactor your code.

    Solution:
        Collapse two exception handlers together.
        Or create a separate function that will handle this second nested case.

        The code without extra ``lambda`` is easier
        to read and is more performant.

    Solution:
        Remove wrapping ``lambda`` declaration, use just the internal function.

    Note, that we allow to check arbitrary length, like ``len(arr) == 3``.

    Reasoning:
        Python's structures like dicts, lists, sets, and tuples
        all have ``__bool__`` method to checks their length.
        So, there's no point in wrapping them into ``len(...)``
        and checking that it is bigger that ``0`` or less then ``1``, etc.

    Solution:

    Reasoning:
        Nesting ternary in random places can lead to very hard
        debug and testing problems.

    Solution:
        Refactor the ternary expression to be either a new variable,

    Reasoning:
        Using static ``list``, ``tuple``, or ``dict`` elements

        Because we need to iterate all over the container to find the element.
        Sets are the best suit for this task.

        what we really mean is ``not something``.

    Solution:
        Use ``not`` with your variable.
        Fix your data types.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        if not my_check:
            ...

        if some_other is None:
            ...

class WrongIsCompareViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbid comparing values with constants using ``is`` or ``is not``.

    However, we allow to compare with ``None`` and booleans.

    Reasoning:
        ``is`` compares might not do what you want them to do.
        Firstly, they check for the same object, not equality.
        Secondly, they behave unexpectedly even
        with the simple values like ``257``.

    Solution:
        Use ``==`` to compare with constants.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        if my_check == [1, 2, 3]:
            ...

        # Wrong:

class ImplicitPrimitiveViolation(ASTViolation):

    Forbid implicit primitives in the form of ``lambda`` functions.

    Reasoning:
        When you use ``lambda`` that returns a primitive value
        and takes no arguments, it means that
        you should use a primitive type instead.

    Solution:
        Replace ``lambda`` with ``int``, ``float``,
        ``list``, or any other primitive.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        defaultdict(int)

    Reasoning:

    Example::

class ImplicitYieldFromViolation(ASTViolation):

        to a ``for`` loop with a ``yield`` inside.
        But, it is way more readable.

    Solution:
        Use ``yield from`` some iterable directly
        instead iterating over it inside a loop
        and ``yield`` it one by one.

    Example::

    Forbid implicit ``.items()`` iterator.

    Reasoning:
        When iterating over collection it is easy to forget
        to use ``.items()`` when you need to access both keys and values.
        So, when you access the iterable with the key inside a ``for`` loop,
        that's a sign to refactor your code.

    Solution:
        Use ``.items()`` with direct keys and values when you need them.

    Example::

    Forbid implicit ``.get()`` dict method.

    Reasoning:
        When using ``in`` with a dict key it is hard to keep the code clean.
        It is more convenient to use ``.get()`` and check for ``None`` later.

    Solution:
        Use ``.get()`` with the key you need.
        Check for ``None`` in case you need it,
        or just act with the default value of the same type.

    Example::

        code.
