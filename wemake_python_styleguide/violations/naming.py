Naming is hard! It is, in fact, one of the two hardest problems.

These checks are required to make your application easier to read
and understand by multiple people over the long period of time.

Naming convention
-----------------

Our naming convention tries to cover all possible cases.
It is partially automated with this linter, but:

- Some rules are still WIP
- Some rules will never be automated, code reviews to the rescue!

General
~~~~~~~

- Use only ``ASCII`` chars for names
- Do not use transliteration from any other languages, translate names instead
- Use clear names, do not use words that do not mean anything like ``obj``
- Use names of an appropriate length: not too short, not too long
- Protected members should use underscore as the first char
- Private names with two leading underscores are not allowed
- If you need to explicitly state that the variable is unused,
  prefix it with ``_`` or just use ``_`` as a name
- Do not use variables that are stated to be unused,
  rename them when actually using them
- Do not define unused variables unless you are unpacking other values as well
- Do not use multiple underscores (``__``) to create unused variables
- Whenever you want to name your variable similar to a keyword or builtin,
  use trailing ``_``
- Do not use consecutive underscores
- When writing abbreviations in ``UpperCase``
  capitalize all letters: ``HTTPAddress``
- When writing abbreviations in ``snake_case`` use lowercase: ``http_address``
- When writing numbers in ``snake_case``
  do not use extra ``_`` before numbers as in ``http2_protocol``

Packages
~~~~~~~~

- Packages must use ``snake_case``
- One word for a package is the most preferable name

Modules
~~~~~~~

- Modules must use ``snake_case``
- Module names must not overuse magic names
- Module names must be valid Python identifiers

Classes
~~~~~~~

- Classes must use ``UpperCase``
- Python's built-in classes, however, are typically lowercase words
- Exception classes must end with ``Error``

Instance attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Instance attributes must use ``snake_case`` with no exceptions

Class attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Class attributes must use ``snake_case``  with no exceptions
- Enum fields also must use ``snamek_case``

Functions and methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Functions and methods must use ``snake_case`` with no exceptions

Method and function arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Instance methods must have their first argument named ``self``
- Class methods must have their first argument named ``cls``
- Metaclass methods must have their first argument named ``mcs``
- Python's ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` should be default names
  when just passing these values to some other method/function,
  unless you want to use these values in place, then name them explicitly
- Keyword-only arguments must be separated from other arguments with ``*``

Global (module level) variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Global variables must use ``CONSTANT_CASE``
- Unless other is required by the API, example: ``urlpatterns`` in Django

Variables
~~~~~~~~~

- Variables must use ``snake_case`` with no exceptions
- When a variable is unused it must be prefixed with an underscore: ``_user``

Type aliases
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Must use ``UpperCase`` as real classes
- Must not contain word ``type`` in its name
- Generic types should be called ``TT`` or ``KT`` or ``VT``
- Covariant and contravariant types
  should be marked with ``Cov`` and ``Contra`` suffixes,
  in this case, one letter can be dropped: ``TCov`` and ``KContra``

        Some module names are not expressive enough.
        It is hard to tell what you can find inside the ``utils.py`` module.

    Solution:
        Rename your module, reorganize the contents.

@final

    """
    Forbids to use module names that do not match our pattern.

    Reasoning:
        Module names must be valid python identifiers.
        And just like the variable names - module names should be consistent.
        Ideally, they should follow the same rules.
        For ``python`` world it is common to use ``snake_case`` notation.

    We use
    :py:data:`~wemake_python_styleguide.constants.MODULE_NAME_PATTERN`

    Example::

    Forbids to have blacklisted variable names.

    Reasoning:
        We have found some names that are not expressive enough.
        However, they appear in the code more than often.
        All names that we forbid to use could be improved.

    Solution:
        Try to use a more specific name instead.
        If you really want to use any of the names from the list,
        add a prefix or suffix to it. It will serve you well.

    See

    Forbids to have too short variable or module names.

    Reasoning:
        It is hard to understand what the variable means and why it is used,
        if its name is too short.

    Solution:
        Think of another name. Give more context to it.

    This rule checks: modules, variables, attributes,
    functions, methods, and classes.

    We do not count trailing and leading underscores when calculating length.

    Reasoning:
        Private is not private in ``python``.

        This might lead to some serious design flaws.

    Solution:
        Rename your variable or method to be protected.
        Think about your design, why do you want to make it private?
        Are there any other ways to achieve what you want?

    This rule checks: modules, variables, attributes, functions, and methods.

    Forbids to use the same alias as the original name in imports.

    When `--i-control-code` is set to ``False``

    Forbids to have names with underscored numbers pattern.

    Reasoning:
        This is done for consistency in naming.

    Solution:
        Do not put an underscore between text and numbers, that is confusing.
        Rename your variable or modules do not include underscored numbers.

    This rule checks: modules, variables, attributes,
    functions, method, and classes.
    Please, note that putting an underscore that replaces ``-`` in some
    names between numbers are fine, example: ``ISO-123-456`` would become

    Forbids to use anything but ``snake_case`` for naming class attributes.

        Constants with upper-case names belong on a module level.

    Solution:
        Move your constants to the module level.
        Rename your variables so that they conform
        to ``snake_case`` convention.

    Reasoning:
        Too long names are unreadable.
        It is better to use a shorter alternative.
        Long names also indicate that this variable is too complex,
        maybe it may require some documentation.

    Solution:

    Forbids to use trailing ``_`` for names that do not need it.

    Reasoning:
        We use trailing underscore for a reason:
        to indicate that this name shadows a built-in or keyword.
        So, when overusing this feature for general names:
        it just harms readability of your program.

    Solution:
        Rename your variable not to contain trailing underscores.

    This rule checks: variables, attributes, functions, methods, and classes.

    Example::

    Forbids to have use variables that are marked as unused.

    We discourage using variables that start with ``_``
    only inside functions and methods as local variables.

    However, we allow to use ``_`` because tools like
    ``ipython``, ``babel``, and ``django`` enforce it.

    Reasoning:
        Sometimes you start to use new logic in your functions,
        and you start to use variables that once were marked as unused.
        But, you have not renamed them for some reason.
        And now you have a lot of confusion: the variable is marked as unused,
        but you are using it. Why? What's going on?

     Solution:
        Rename your variable to be a regular variable
        without a leading underscore.
