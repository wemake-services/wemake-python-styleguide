Violation can not have more than one base class.
See :ref:`tutorial` for more information about choosing a correct base class.

Conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Each violation class name should end with "Violation"
- Each violation must have a long docstring with full description
- Each violation must have "Reasoning" and "Solution" sections
- Each violation must have "versionadded" policy
- Each violation should have an example with correct and wrong usages
- If violation error template should have a parameter
  it should be the last part of the text: ``: {0}``
