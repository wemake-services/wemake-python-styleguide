"""
These checks help to prevent incorrect usage of Python 3 typing annotations.

While they maybe of a great help in writing clear
and concise code, they still can be abused.

Once again, these rules are highly subjective. But, we love them.

    Forbids to use ``Literal[None]`` typing annotation.

    Reasoning:
        Literal[None] is just the same as None.
        There's no need to use the first version.
        It is not type related, it is a consistency rule.

    Solution:
        Replace ``Literal[None]`` with ``None``.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        def func(empty: None):
            '''Empty function.'''

        # Wrong:
        def func(empty: Literal[None]):

@final
class NestedAnnotationsViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbids use of nested Literal and Union Annotation.

    Reasoning:
        There is no need to nest certain annotations of the same type.
        They are exactly equivalent to the flattened version.
        Use the flattened version for consistency.

    Solution:
        Flatten consecutively nested ``typing.Literal`` and ``typing.Union``.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        Literal[1, 2, 3, "foo", 5, None]
        Union[int, str, float]

        # Wrong:

@final
class UnionNestedInOptionalViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbids to use ``Optional[Union[int, str]]`` annotation.

    Reasoning:
        Optional[Union[int, str]] equals to Union[int, str, None].
        Use Union[int, str, None] version for consistency.

    Solution:
        Replace ``Optional[Union[int, str]]`` with ``Union[int, str, None]``.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        Union[int, str, None]
