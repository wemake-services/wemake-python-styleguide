These checks find flaws in your application design.

We try to stick to "the magical 7 Â± 2 number" when counting things.

That's how many objects we can keep in our memory at a time.
We try hard not to exceed the memory capacity limit.

    Forbids to have modules with too many imports.

    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

    Reasoning:
        Having too many imports without prefixes is quite expensive.
        You have to memorize all the source locations of the imports.
        And sometimes it is hard to remember what kind of functions and classes
        are already injected into your context.

        It is also a questionable design if a single module has a lot of
        imports. Why a single module has so many dependencies?
        So, it becomes too coupled.

    Solution:
        Refactor the imports to import a common namespace. Something like
        ``from package import module`` and then
        use it like ``module.function()``.

        Or refactor your code and split the complex module into several ones.

        Having many classes and functions in a single module is a bad thing.

    Solution:
        It is better to split this module into several modules or a package.

# Functions and classes:

@final
class TooManyLocalsViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbids to have too many local variables in the unit of code.

    Reasoning:
        Having too many variables in a single function is a bad thing.
        Soon, you will find troubles to understand what this variable means.
        It will also become hard to name new variables.

    Solution:
        If you have too many variables in a function, you have to refactor it.

    What counts as a local variable? We only count variable as local
    in the following case: it is assigned inside the function body.
    We do not count variables defined inside comprehensions as local variables,
    since it is impossible to use them outside of the comprehension.

    Example::

        def first_function(param):
            first_var = 1

        def second_function(argument):
            second_var = 1
            argument = int(argument)
            third_var, _ = some_call()

    In this example we will count as locals only several variables:

    1. ``first_var``, because it is assigned inside the function's body
    2. ``second_var``, because it is assigned inside the function's body
    3. ``argument``, because it is reassigned inside the function's body
    4. ``third_var``, because it is assigned inside the function's body

    Please, note that ``_`` is a special case. It is not counted as a local
    variable. Since by design it means: do not count me as a real variable.

        This rule is configurable with ``--max-local-variables``.

        arguments it shows that it is required to refactor this piece of code.
        It also indicates that function does too many things at once.

    Reasoning:
        Having too many methods might lead to the "God object".
        This kind of objects can handle everything.
        So, in the end, your code becomes too hard to maintain and test.

    Solution:
        What to do if you have too many methods in a single class?
        Split this class into several classes.
        Then use composition or inheritance to refactor your code.
        This will protect you from "God object" anti-pattern.

        It is hard to understand ``mro`` and ``super`` calls.
        Do not overuse this technique.

    Solution:
        Reduce the number of base classes.

        You have to ask yourself: do I really know what happens inside
        this decorator tree? Typically, the answer will be "no".

    Solution:

        you try to configure the behavior from outside of the class.

@final
class LineComplexityViolation(ASTViolation):

    Forbids to have complex lines.

    We are using Jones Complexity algorithm to count complexity.
    What is Jones Complexity? It is a simple yet powerful method to count
    the number of ``ast`` nodes per line.
    If the complexity of a single line is higher than a threshold,
    then an error is raised.

    What nodes do we count? All except the following:

    1. modules
    2. function and classes, since they are checked differently
    3. type annotations, since they do not increase the complexity

    Reasoning:
        Having a complex line indicates that you somehow managed to put too
        much logic inside a single line.
        At some point in time, you will no longer be able to understand
        what this line means and what it does.

    Solution:
        Split a single line into several lines: by creating new variables,
        statements or functions. Note, this might trigger new complexity issues.
        With this technique, a single new node in a line might trigger a complex

    Solution:
        We can reduce the complexity of a single ``if`` by doing two things:
