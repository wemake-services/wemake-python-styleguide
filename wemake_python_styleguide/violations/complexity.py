class OverusedExpressionViolation(ASTViolation):

    Forbid overused expressions in a module, function or method.

    What do we call an "overused expression"? When you use any expression
    (like ``user_dict['age']`` for example) inside your code,
    you always have to track that you are not using it "too much"
    because if that expression is everywhere inside your code,
    it is a sign of a problem. It means that you are missing an abstraction.

    We check for overused expressions on two levels:

    - per each function
    - per all module

    Related to :class:`~TooManyExpressionsViolation`.

    Reasoning:
        Overusing expressions leads to losing the parts that can and should
        be refactored into variables, methods, and properties of objects.

    Solution:
        Refactor expressions to be an attribute, a method, or a new variable.

# Functions and classes:

@final
class TooManyLocalsViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbid too many local variables in the unit of code.

    Reasoning:
        Having too many variables in a single function is a bad thing.
        Soon, you will have trouble understanding what this variable means.
        It will also become hard to name new variables.

    Solution:
        If you have too many variables in a function, you have to refactor it.

    What counts as a local variable? We only count a variable as local
    in the following case: it is assigned inside the function body.
    We do not count variables defined inside comprehensions as local variables,
    since it is impossible to use them outside of the comprehension.

    Example::

        def first_function(param):
            first_var = 1

        def second_function(argument):
            second_var = 1
            argument = int(argument)
            third_var, _ = some_call()

    In this example we will count as locals only several variables:

    1. ``first_var``, because it is assigned inside the function's body
    2. ``second_var``, because it is assigned inside the function's body
    3. ``argument``, because it is reassigned inside the function's body
    4. ``third_var``, because it is assigned inside the function's body

    Please, note that ``_`` is a special case. It is not counted as a local
    variable. Since by design it means: do not count me as a real variable.

        So, in the end, your code becomes too hard to maintain and test.

    Solution:
        What to do if you have too many methods in a single class?

        At some point in time, you will no longer be able to understand

    Reasoning:
        Handling too many exceptions in a single place
        is a good indicator of a bad design
        since one controlling structure will become too complex.
        Also, you will need to test a lot of logic paths in your application.

    Solution:
        We can reduce the complexity of this case by splitting it into multiple

    Reasoning:
        When some string is used more than several time in your code,
        it probably means that this string is a meaningful constant
        and should be treated like one.

    Solution:

    Configuration:

        since it is not expected.

    Solution:
        Move things out of the ``try`` block or create new functions.

    Reasoning:
        Having too many public instance attributes means
