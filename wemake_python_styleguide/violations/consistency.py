"""
These checks limit the Python's inconsistency.

We can do the same things differently in Python.
For example, there are three ways to format a string.
There are several ways to write the same number.

We like our code to be consistent.
It is easier to bare with your code base if you follow these rules.

So, we choose a single way to do things.
It does not mean that we choose the best way to do it.
But, we value consistency more than being 100% right.
And we are ready to suffer all trade-offs that might come.

Once again, these rules are highly subjective. But, we love them.

@final
class UnderscoredNumberViolation(TokenizeViolation):
    """
    Forbids to use underscores (``_``) in numbers.

    Reasoning:
        It is possible to write ``1000`` in three different ways:
        ``1_000``, ``10_00``, and ``100_0``.
        And it would be still the same number.
        Count how many ways there are to write bigger numbers.
        Currently, it all depends on the cultural habits of the author.
        We enforce a single way to write numbers: without the underscore.

    Solution:
        Numbers should be written as numbers: ``1000``.
        If you have a very big number with a lot of zeros, use multiplication.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        phone = 88313443
        million = 1000000

        # Wrong:

    Reasoning:
        Partial numbers are hard to read and they can be confused with
        other numbers. For example, it is really
        easy to confuse ``0.5`` and ``.05`` when reading
        through the source code.

    Solution:
        Use full versions with leading and starting zeros.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        half = 0.5
        ten_float = 10.0

        # Wrong:

@final
class FormattedStringViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbids to use ``f`` strings.

    Reasoning:
        ``f`` strings loses context too often and they are hard to lint.
        Imagine that you have a string that breaks
        when you move it two lines above.
        That's not how a string should behave.
        Also, they promote a bad practice:
        putting your logic inside the template.

    Solution:
        Use ``.format()`` with indexed params instead.

    See also:
        https://github.com/xZise/flake8-string-format

    Example::

        # Wrong:
        f'Result is: {2 + 2}'

        'Result is: {0}'.format(2 + 2)

    """
    Forbids to write classes without base classes.

    Reasoning:
        We just need to decide how to do it.
        We need a single and unified rule about base classes.
        We have decided to stick to the explicit base class notation.

    Solution:
        Add a base class.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        class Some(object): ...

@final
class MultipleIfsInComprehensionViolation(ASTViolation):

    Forbids to have multiple ``if`` statements inside list comprehensions.

    Reasoning:
        It is very hard to read multiple ``if`` statements inside
        a list comprehension. Since it is even hard to tell all of them
        should pass or fail.

    Solution:
        Use a single ``if`` statement inside list comprehensions.
        Use ``filter()`` if you have complicated logic.

    Example::

        # Wrong:
        nodes = [node for node in html if node != 'b' if node != 'i']

        # Correct:
        nodes = [node for node in html if node not in ('b', 'i')]

        When two constants are compared it is typically an indication of a
        mistake, since the Boolean value of the compare, will always be
        the same.

    Solution:
        Remove the constant compare and any associated dead code.

    Example::

        # Wrong:
        if 60 * 60 < 1000:

    Reasoning:
        It is hard to read the code when
        you have to shuffle ordering of the arguments all the time.
        Bring consistency to the compare!

    Solution:
        Refactor your compare expression, place the argument first.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        if some_x > 3:
        if 3 < some_x < 10:

@final
class BadNumberSuffixViolation(TokenizeViolation):
    """
    Forbids to use capital ``X``, ``O``, ``B``, and ``E`` in numbers.

    Reasoning:
        Octal, hex, binary and scientific notation suffixes could
        be written in two possible notations: lowercase and uppercase.
        Which brings confusion and decreases code consistency and readability.
        We enforce a single way to write numbers with suffixes:
        suffix with lowercase chars.

    Solution:
        Octal, hex, binary and scientific notation suffixes in numbers
        should be written lowercase.

    Example::

    Forbids comparision where multiple ``in`` checks.

    Reasoning:
        Using multiple ``in`` is unreadable.

    Solution:
        Refactor your compare expression to use several ``and`` conditions
        or separate ``if`` statements in case it is appropriate.

    Example::

        if item in bucket and bucket in master_list_of_buckets:

        The same happened to good old ``print`` in Python2.

    Solution:

    Solution:

        parents - we should not allow it for the consistency reasons.

    Solution:

        Why should we even care about this magic coding comment?
        For several reasons.

        First, explicit encoding is always better that an implicit one,
        different countries still use some non utf-8 encodings as a default.
        But, people might override it with other encodings in a comment.
        Do you know how much pain it can cause to you?

        We still know that ``python3`` uses ``utf-8`` inside.

        Second, some tools break because of this incorrect encoding comment.
        Including, ``django``, ``flake8``, and ``tokenize`` core module.
        It is very hard to notice these things when they happen.

        Add an empty line between ``coding`` magic comment and your code.
