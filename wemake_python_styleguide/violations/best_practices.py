    Restricts to use several control (or magic) comments.

    We do not allow to use:

    1. ``# noqa`` comment without specified violations
    2. ``# type: some_type`` comments to specify a type for ``typed_ast``

    Reasoning:
        We cover several different use-cases in a single rule.
        ``# noqa`` comment is restricted because it can hide other violations.
        ``# type: some_type`` comment is restricted because
        we can already use type annotations instead.

    Solution:
        Use ``# noqa`` comments with specified error types.
        Use type annotations to specify types.

    We still allow to use ``# type: ignore`` comment.
    Since sometimes it is totally required.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        type = MyClass.get_type()  # noqa: A001
        coordinate: int = 10
        some.int_field = 'text'  # type: ignore

        Doc comments are used to provide a documentation.

    Solution:

    Forbids to have some module level variables.

    Reasoning:
        We discourage using module variables like ``__author__``,

    Solution:
        Place all the metadata in ``setup.py``,
        ``setup.cfg``, or ``pyproject.toml``.
        Use proper docstrings and packaging classifiers.
        Use ``pkg_resources`` if you need to import this data into your app.

        If you have an empty module there are two ways to handle that:

    Reasoning:
        If you have logic inside the ``__init__`` module
        it means several things:

        1. you are keeping some outdated stuff there, you need to refactor
        2. you are placing this logic into the wrong file,
           just create another one

        or just not user-friendly like ``del``.

    Solution:
        Solutions differ from keyword to keyword.
        ``pass`` should be replaced with docstring or ``contextlib.suppress``.
        ``del`` should be replaced with specialized methods like ``.pop()``.

    Solution:
        Handle ``Exception``, ``KeyboardInterrupt``,
        ``GeneratorExit``, and ``SystemExit`` separately.
        Do not use the plain ``except:`` keyword.

class NestedFunctionViolation(ASTViolation):

    Forbids to have nested functions.

    Reasoning:
        Nesting functions is a bad practice.
        It is hard to test them, it is hard then to separate them.
        People tend to overuse closures, so it's hard to manage the dataflow.

    Solution:
        Just write flat functions, there's no need to nest them.
        Pass parameters as normal arguments, do not use closures.
        Until you need them for decorators or factories.

    We also disallow to nest ``lambda`` and ``async`` functions.

        Nested classes are really hard to manage.
        You can not even create an instance of this class in many cases.
        Testing them is also really hard.

    Solution:
        Just write flat classes, there's no need nest them.
        If you are nesting classes inside a function for parametrization,
        then you will probably need to use different design (or metaclasses).

@final
class MagicNumberViolation(ASTViolation):

    Forbids to use magic numbers in your code.

    What we call a "magic number"? Well, it is actually any number that
    appears in your code out of nowhere. Like ``42``. Or ``0.32``.

    Reasoning:
        It is very hard to remember what these numbers actually mean.
        Why were they used? Should they ever be changed?
        Or are they eternal like ``3.14``?

    Solution:
        Give these numbers a name! Move them to a separate variable,
        giving more context to the reader. And by moving things into new
        variables you will trigger other complexity checks.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        price_in_euro = 3.33  # could be changed later
        total = get_items_from_cart() * price_in_euro

        # Wrong:
        total = get_items_from_cart() * 3.33

    What are numbers that we exclude from this check?
    Any numbers that are assigned to a variable, array, dictionary,
    or keyword arguments inside a function.
    ``int`` numbers that are in range ``[-10, 10]`` and
    some other common numbers, that are defined in
