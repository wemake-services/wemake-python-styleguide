class WrongMagicCommentViolation(SimpleViolation):
    """
    Restricts to use several control (or magic) comments.

    We do not allow to use:

    1. ``# noqa`` comment without specified violations
    2. ``# type: some_type`` comments to specify a type for ``typed_ast``

    Reasoning:
        We cover several different use-cases in a single rule.
        ``# noqa`` comment is restricted because it can hide other violations.
        ``# type: some_type`` comment is restricted because
        we can already use type annotations instead.

    Solution:
        Use ``# noqa`` comments with specified error types.
        Use type annotations to specify types.

    We still allow to use ``# type: ignore`` comment.
    Since sometimes it is totally required.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        type = MyClass.get_type()  # noqa: A001
        coordinate: int = 10
        some.int_field = 'text'  # type: ignore

        # Wrong:
        type = MyClass.get_type()  # noqa
        coordinate = 10  # type: int

    """
    Forbids to use empty doc comments (``#:``).

    Reasoning:
        Doc comments are used to provide a documentation.
        But supplying empty doc comments breaks this use-case.
        It is unclear why they can be used with no contents.

    Solution:
        Add some documentation to this comment. Or remove it.

    Empty doc comments are not caught by the default ``pycodestyle`` checks.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        #: List of allowed names:

class WrongModuleMetadataViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbids to have some module level variables.

    Reasoning:
        We discourage using module variables like ``__author__``,
        because code should not contain any metadata.

    Solution:
        Place all the metadata in ``setup.py``,
        ``setup.cfg``, or ``pyproject.toml``.
        Use proper docstrings and packaging classifiers.
        Use ``pkg_resources`` if you need to import this data into your app.

class EmptyModuleViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbids to have empty modules.

    Reasoning:
        Why is it even there? Do not polute your project with empty files.

    Solution:
        If you have an empty module there are two ways to handle that:

        1. delete it
        2. drop some documentation in it, so you will explain why it is there

class InitModuleHasLogicViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbids to have logic inside ``__init__`` module.

    Reasoning:
        If you have logic inside the ``__init__`` module
        it means several things:

        1. you are keeping some outdated stuff there, you need to refactor
        2. you are placing this logic into the wrong file,
           just create another one
        3. you are doing some dark magic, and you should not do that

    Solution:
        Put your code in other modules.

    However, we allow to have some contents inside the ``__init__`` module:

    1. comments, since they are dropped before AST comes in play
    2. docs string, because sometimes it is required to state something

# Modules:

class WrongKeywordViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbids to use some keywords from ``python``.

    Reasoning:
        We believe that some keywords are anti-patterns.
        They promote bad-practices like ``global`` and ``pass``,
        or just not user-friendly like ``del``.

    Solution:
        Solutions differ from keyword to keyword.
        ``pass`` should be replaced with docstring or ``contextlib.suppress``.
        ``del`` should be replaced with specialized methods like ``.pop()``.
        ``global`` and ``nonlocal`` usages should be refactored.

    Example::

class FutureImportViolation(ASTViolation):

    Forbids to use ``__future__`` imports.

    Reasoning:
        Almost all ``__future__`` imports are legacy ``python2`` compatibility
        tools that are no longer required.

    Solution:
        Remove them. Drop ``python2`` support.

    Except, there are some new ones for ``python4`` support.

class RaiseNotImplementedViolation(ASTViolation):

        These two violations look so similar.

        Use cases of ``NotImplemented`` is too limited
        to be generally available.

# Design:

class NestedFunctionViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbids to have nested functions.

    Reasoning:
        Nesting functions is a bad practice.
        It is hard to test them, it is hard then to separate them.
        People tend to overuse closures, so it's hard to manage the dataflow.

    Solution:
        Just write flat functions, there's no need to nest them.
        Pass parameters as normal arguments, do not use closures.
        Until you need them for decorators or factories.

    We also disallow to nest ``lambda`` and ``async`` functions.

    See
    :py:data:`~wemake_python_styleguide.constants.NESTED_FUNCTIONS_WHITELIST`
    for the whole list of whitelisted names.

class NestedClassViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbids to use nested classes.

    Reasoning:
        Nested classes are really hard to manage.
        You can not even create an instance of this class in many cases.
        Testing them is also really hard.

    Solution:
        Just write flat classes, there's no need nest them.
        If you are nesting classes inside a function for parametrization,
        then you will probably need to use different design (or metaclasses).

class MagicNumberViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbids to use magic numbers in your code.

    What we call a "magic number"? Well, it is actually any number that
    appears in your code out of nowhere. Like ``42``. Or ``0.32``.

    Reasoning:
        It is very hard to remember what these numbers actually mean.
        Why were they used? Should they ever be changed?
        Or are they eternal like ``3.14``?

    Solution:
        Give these numbers a name! Move them to a separate variable,
        giving more context to the reader. And by moving things into new
        variables you will trigger other complexity checks.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        price_in_euro = 3.33  # could be changed later
        total = get_items_from_cart() * price_in_euro

        # Wrong:
        total = get_items_from_cart() * 3.33

    What are numbers that we exclude from this check?
    Any numbers that are assigned to a variable, array, dictionary,
    or keyword arguments inside a function.
    ``int`` numbers that are in range ``[-10, 10]`` and
    some other common numbers, that are defined in

    Reasoning:

    Solution:
        Use instance methods, ``@classmethod``, or functions instead.

class BadMagicMethodViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbids to use some magic methods.

    Reasoning:
        We forbid to use magic methods related to the forbidden language parts.
        Likewise, we forbid to use ``del`` keyword, so we forbid to use all
        magic methods related to it.

class NestedImportViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbids to have nested imports in functions.

    Reasoning:
        Usually nested imports are used to fix the import cycle.
        So, nested imports show that there's an issue with you design.

    Solution:
        You don't need nested imports, you need to refactor your code.
        Introduce a new module or find another way to do what you want to do.
        Rethink how your layered architecture should look like.
