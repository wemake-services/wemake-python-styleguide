class WrongMagicCommentViolation(SimpleViolation):
    """
    Restricts to use several control (or magic) comments.

    We do not allow to use:

    1. ``# noqa`` comment without specified violations
    2. ``# type: some_type`` comments to specify a type for ``typed_ast``

    Reasoning:
        We cover several different use-cases in a single rule.
        ``# noqa`` comment is restricted because it can hide other violations.
        ``# type: some_type`` comment is restricted because
        we can already use type annotations instead.

    Solution:
        Use ``# noqa`` comments with specified error types.
        Use type annotations to specify types.

    We still allow to use ``# type: ignore`` comment.
    Since sometimes it is totally required.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        type = MyClass.get_type()  # noqa: A001
        coordinate: int = 10
        some.int_field = 'text'  # type: ignore

        Doc comments are used to provide a documentation.

    Solution:
        Add some documentation to this comment. Or remove it.

    Empty doc comments are not caught by the default ``pycodestyle`` checks.

    Forbids to have some module level variables.

    Reasoning:
        We discourage using module variables like ``__author__``,
        because code should not contain any metadata.

    Solution:
        Place all the metadata in ``setup.py``,
        ``setup.cfg``, or ``pyproject.toml``.
        Use proper docstrings and packaging classifiers.

        If you have an empty module there are two ways to handle that:

    Forbids to have logic inside ``__init__`` module.

    Reasoning:
        If you have logic inside the ``__init__`` module
        it means several things:

        1. you are keeping some outdated stuff there, you need to refactor
        2. you are placing this logic into the wrong file,
           just create another one
        3. you are doing some dark magic, and you should not do that

    Solution:
        Put your code in other modules.

    However, we allow to have some contents inside the ``__init__`` module:

    1. comments, since they are dropped before AST comes in play
    2. docs string, because sometimes it is required to state something

    It is also fine when you have different users that use your code.
    And you do not want to break everything for them.
    In this case this rule can be configured.

    Configuration:
        This rule is configurable with ``--i-control-code``.

        We believe that some keywords are anti-patterns.
        They promote bad-practices like ``global`` and ``pass``,
        or just not user-friendly like ``del``.

    Solution:
        Solutions differ from keyword to keyword.
        ``pass`` should be replaced with docstring or ``contextlib.suppress``.
        ``del`` should be replaced with specialized methods like ``.pop()``.
        ``global`` and ``nonlocal`` usages should be refactored.

    Reasoning:

        tools that are no longer required.

    Solution:
        Remove them. Drop ``python2`` support.

    Except, there are some new ones for ``python4`` support.

    Reasoning:
        We can silence system exit and keyboard interrupt with this exception

    Solution:
        Handle ``Exception``, ``KeyboardInterrupt``,
        ``GeneratorExit``, and ``SystemExit`` separately.
        Do not use the plain ``except:`` keyword.

    Forbids to pass booleans as non-keyword parameters.

        It is almost impossible to tell, what does this parameter means.
        And you almost always have to look up the implementation to tell
        what is going on.

    Solution:
        Pass booleans as keywords only.
        This will help you to save extra context on what's going on.

    Forbids to have nested functions.

    Reasoning:
        Nesting functions is a bad practice.
        It is hard to test them, it is hard then to separate them.
        People tend to overuse closures, so it's hard to manage the dataflow.

    Solution:
        Just write flat functions, there's no need to nest them.
        Pass parameters as normal arguments, do not use closures.
        Until you need them for decorators or factories.

    We also disallow to nest ``lambda`` and ``async`` functions.

    Reasoning:
        Nested classes are really hard to manage.
        You can not even create an instance of this class in many cases.
        Testing them is also really hard.

    Solution:
        Just write flat classes, there's no need nest them.
        If you are nesting classes inside a function for parametrization,
        then you will probably need to use different design (or metaclasses).

    Forbids to use magic numbers in your code.

    What we call a "magic number"? Well, it is actually any number that
    appears in your code out of nowhere. Like ``42``. Or ``0.32``.

    Reasoning:
        It is very hard to remember what these numbers actually mean.
        Why were they used? Should they ever be changed?
        Or are they eternal like ``3.14``?

    Solution:
        Give these numbers a name! Move them to a separate variable,
        giving more context to the reader. And by moving things into new
        variables you will trigger other complexity checks.

    Example::

        # Correct:

        total = get_items_from_cart() * price_in_euro

    Any numbers that are assigned to a variable, array, dictionary,
    or keyword arguments inside a function.
    ``int`` numbers that are in range ``[-10, 10]`` and

    Solution:
        You don't need nested imports, you need to refactor your code.

    Forbids to use protected attributes and methods.

    Reasoning:
        When using protected attributes and method we break a contract
        that authors of this class enforce.
        This way we are not respecting encapsulation and it may break
        our code at any moment.

    Solution:
        Do not use protected attributes and methods.
        Respect the encapsulation.

    Example::

    Reasoning:
        It is error-prone to use ``lambda`` inside

    Solution:
        Use regular functions, factory functions, or ``partial`` functions.
        Save yourself from possible confusion.

    Example::

class UnreachableCodeViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbids to have unreachable code.

    What is unreachable code? It is some lines of code that
    cannot be executed by python's interpreter.

    This is probably caused by ``return`` or ``raise`` statements.
    However, we can not cover 100% of truly unreachable code by this rule.
    This happens due to the dynamic nature of python.
    For example, detecting that ``1 / some_value`` would sometimes raise
    an exception is too complicated and is out of the scope of this rule.

    Reasoning:
        Having dead code in your project is an indicator that you
        do not care about your code base at all.
        It dramatically reduces code quality and readability.
        It also demotivates team members.

    Solution:
        Delete any unreachable code you have.
        Or refactor it, if this happens by your mistake.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        def some_function():

    Solution:

        this technique. So, do not use it.

    Solution:

        Other one will always be ignored. So, that is clearly an error.

        it just does not make any sense. Since ``set`` can not contain
        duplicate items and they will be removed anyway.

    Reasoning:

        Use ``bool()`` to convert test values to boolean values.
        Or just leave it as it is in case

        Python allows us to have conditions, context managers,

        So, we discourage using anything except these nodes in class bodies.

        We should not allow anything rather than tuples to define slots,

        The problem with ``return`` in ``else`` and ``finally``
        is that it is impossible to say what value is going to be actually

        Because ``return`` does not expect
