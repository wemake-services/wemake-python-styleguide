These checks ensures that you use Python's version of OOP correctly.

There are different gotchas in Python to write beautiful classes
and using objects correctly. That's the place we collect these kind of rules.

    Forbid subclassing lowercase builtins.

    We forbid to subclass builtins like ``int``, ``str``, ``bool``, etc.
    We allow to subclass ``object`` and ``type``, warnings, and exceptions.

    See
    :py:data:`~wemake_python_styleguide.constants.ALLOWED_BUILTIN_CLASSES`
    for the whole list of whitelisted names.

    Reasoning:
        It is almost never a good idea (unless you do something sneaky)
        to subclass primitive builtins.

    Solution:
        Use custom objects around some wrapper.
        Use magic methods to emulate the desired behaviour.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        class Some(object): ...
        class MyValueException(ValueError): ...

        # Wrong:

@final
class ShadowedClassAttributeViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbid shadowing class level attributes with instance level attributes.

    Reasoning:
        This way you will have two attributes inside your ``__mro__`` chain:
        one from instance and one from class. It might cause errors.
        Needless to say, that this is just pointless to do so.

        Also, if you ever want to optimise your code with a tool like `mypyc`_,
        this rule is a requirement.

    Solution:
        Use either class attributes or instance attributes.
        Use ``ClassVar`` type on fields that are declared as class attributes.

    Note, that we cannot find shadowed attributes that are defined
    in parent classes. That's where ``ClassVar`` is required for ``mypy``
    to check it for you.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        from typing import ClassVar

        class First(object):
            field: ClassVar[int] = 1

        class Second(object):
            field: int

            def __init__(self) -> None:
                self.field = 1

class StaticMethodViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbid ``@staticmethod`` decorator.

    Reasoning:
        Static methods are not required to be inside the class.
        Because they even do not have access to the current instance.

    Solution:
        Use instance methods, ``@classmethod``, or functions instead.

    """
    Forbid certain magic methods.

    Reasoning:
        We forbid to use magic methods related to the forbidden language parts.
        Likewise, we forbid to use ``del`` keyword, so we forbid to use all
        magic methods related to it.

    Solution:
        Refactor your code to use custom methods instead.
        It will give more context to your app.

@final
class WrongClassBodyContentViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbid incorrect nodes inside ``class`` definitions.

    Reasoning:
        Python allows us to have conditions, context managers,
        and even infinite loops inside ``class`` definitions.
        On the other hand, only methods, attributes, and docstrings make sense.
        So, we discourage using anything except these nodes in class bodies.

    Solution:
        If you have complex logic inside your class definition,
        most likely that you do something wrong.
        There are different options to refactor this mess.
        You can try metaclasses, decorators, builders, and other patterns.

    Example::

        # Wrong:
        class Test(object):
            for _ in range(10):
                print('What?!')

@final
class MethodWithoutArgumentsViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbid methods without any arguments.

    Reasoning:
        Methods without arguments are allowed to be defined,
        but almost impossible to use.
        Furthermore, they don't have an access to ``self``,
        so cannot access the inner state of the object.
        It might be an intentional design or just a typo.

    Solution:
        Move any methods with arguments to raw functions.
        Or just add an argument if it is actually required.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        class Test(object):
            def method(self): ...

        # Wrong:
        class Test(object):

@final
class WrongBaseClassViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbid anything other than a class as a base class.

    We only check base classes and not keywords. They can be anything you need.

    Reasoning:
        In Python you can specify anything in the base classes slot.
        In runtime this expression will be evaluated and executed.
        We need to prevent dirty hacks in this field.

    Solution:
        Use only attributes, names, and types to be your base classes.
        Use ``annotation`` future import in case
        you use strings in base classes.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        class Test(module.ObjectName, MixinName, keyword=True): ...
        class GenericClass(Generic[ValueType]): ...

        # Wrong:

@final
class WrongSlotsViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbid incorrect ``__slots__`` definition.

    Things that this rule checks:

    - That ``__slots__`` is a tuple, name, attribute, star, or call
    - That ``__slots__`` do not have duplicates
    - That ``__slots__`` do not have empty strings or invalid python names

    Reasoning:
        ``__slots__`` is a very special attribute.
        It completely changes your class. So, we need to be careful with it.
        We should not allow anything rather than tuples to define slots,
        we also need to check that fields defined in ``__slots__`` are unique.

    Solution:
        Use tuples with unique elements to define ``__slots__`` attribute.
        Use ``snake_case`` to define attributes in ``__slots__``.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        class Test(object):
            __slots__ = ('field1', 'field2')

        class Other(Test):
            __slots__ = (*Test.__slots__, 'child')

        # Wrong:
        class Test(object):
            __slots__ = ['field1', 'field2', 'field2']

    Note, that we do ignore all complex expressions for this field.
    So, we only check raw literals.

@final
class WrongSuperCallViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbid ``super()`` with parameters or outside of methods.

    Reasoning:
        ``super()`` is a very special function.
        It implicitly relies on the context where it is used
        and parameters passed to it.
        So, we should be very careful with parameters and context.

    Solution:
        Use ``super()`` without arguments and only inside methods.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        super().__init__()

        # Wrong:
        super(ClassName, self).__init__()

    .. versionadded:: 0.7.0

@final
class DirectMagicAttributeAccessViolation(ASTViolation):
    """
    Forbid direct magic attributes and methods.

    Reasoning:
        When using direct magic attributes or method
        it means that you are doing something wrong.
        Magic methods are not suited to be directly called or accessed.

    Solution:
        Use special syntax constructs that will call underlying magic methods.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        super().__init__()

        # Wrong:
        2..__truediv__(2)
        d.__delitem__('a')

    Note, that it is possible to use direct magic attributes with
    ``self``, ``cls``, and ``super()`` as base names.
    We allow this because a lot of internal logic relies on these methods.

    Forbid certain async magic methods.

    See

    for the whole list of blacklisted async magic methods.

    Reasoning:
        Defining the magic methods as async which are not supposed
        to be async would not work as expected.

    Solution:
        Do not make this magic method async.

    Example::

    Reasoning:
        Python's datamodel is strict.
        You cannot make generators from random magic methods.
        This rule enforces it.

    Solution:
        Remove ``yield`` from a magic method
