    """
    Fixes ``col_offest`` values for async nodes.

    This is a temporary check for async-based expressions, because offset
    for them isn't calculated properly. We can calculate right version
    of offset with subscripting ``6`` (length of "async " part).

    Affected ``python`` versions:

    - all versions below ``python3.6.7``

    Adjusts line number for some nodes.

    They are set incorrectly for some collections.
    It might be either a bug or a feature.

    We do several checks here, to be sure that we won't get
    an incorrect line number. But, we basically check if there's
    a parent, so we can compare and adjust.

    Example::

        print((  # should start from here
            1, 2, 3,  # actually starts from here
        ))
