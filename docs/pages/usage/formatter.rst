Formatter
=========

Custom formatter for ``flake8`` :term:`violations <violation>`.

Tries to be beautiful, compact, and informative.
Improves the default formatter used by ``flake8``.


.. rubric:: Usage

To activate this formatter one will need to run:

.. code:: bash

  flake8 --format=wemake your_module.py

Or set the configuration option inside ``setup.cfg`` file:

.. code:: ini

  [flake8]
  format = wemake

Option ``format = wemake`` is included into our default configuration.

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wemake-services/wemake-python-styleguide/master/docs/_static/running.png

To switch back to the default ``flake8`` formatter,
you can use ``format = default`` option.

There are other formatters out there as well.
They can be installed as plugins.


.. rubric:: Showing source code

You can also (and we recommend to) enable ``--show-source`` option.
It can be passed as a command line argument or set in ``setup.cfg``:

.. code:: ini

  [flake8]
  show-source = True

It will change how your reports are formatted,
and will show the exact problem with your code:

.. code::

  » flake8 . --format=wemake --show-source

  ./wemake_python_styleguide/formatter.py

    107:32   E231  missing whitespace after ':'
    def show_source(self, error:Violation) -> str:
                               ^

It helps to visually identify the problems in your code and fix it faster.
We include ``show-source = True`` into our default configuration.


.. rubric:: Showing statistic

You can also enable ``--statistics`` option.
It can be passed as a command line argument or set in ``setup.cfg``:

.. code:: ini

  [flake8]
  statistics = True

It will group all violations by type and tell how many of them
do you have and where you have them:

.. code::

  » flake8 . --format=wemake --show-source --statistics

  ./wemake_python_styleguide/formatter.py

    107:32   E231  missing whitespace after ':'
    def show_source(self, error:Violation) -> str:
                               ^

  ./wemake_python_styleguide/types.py

    53:47    E231  missing whitespace after ','
    AnyFunctionDefAndLambda = Union[AnyFunctionDef,ast.Lambda]
                                                  ^

  E231: missing whitespace after ':'
    1     ./wemake_python_styleguide/formatter.py
    1     ./wemake_python_styleguide/types.py
  Total: 2


  All errors: 2

We do not include ``statistics = True`` in our default configuration.
It should be only called when user needs to find how many violations
there are and what files do contain them.


.. rubric:: Showing links to documentation

You can also show links to the documentation pages of violations:

.. code::

  » flake8 . --format=wemake --show-source --show-violation-links

  ./wemake_python_styleguide/formatter.py

    107:32   E231  missing whitespace after ':'
             -> https://pyflak.es/E231
    def show_source(self, error:Violation) -> str:
                               ^

In modern terminals, you can click them to open the respective docs page.

We do not include ``show-violation-links`` in our default configuration.


.. rubric:: Disabling colors and text highlight

Set ``NO_COLOR=1`` environment variable
to completely disable all text highligt and colors
in ``wemake`` formatter.

See https://no-color.org for more information about ``NO_COLOR``.
