Configuration
=============

Before going any further, make sure
that you are familiar with ``flake8``
`configuration process <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html>`_.

By default we encourage everyone to use ``setup.cfg`` to store all
the configuration to all ``python`` projects.

.. rubric:: Ignoring violations

We know that people might not agree with 100% of our rules.
But we still want to provide the best experience for all users.

So, you can disable some checks, that you are not ok with.
**Note**: you might accidentally break the consistency of this project,
when you disable some checks.
`Report <https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-python-styleguide/issues>`_
these cases.

There are three ways to ignore some specific violations:

1. Inline ignore with ``# noqa:`` comment and comma separated violation codes
2. Command line argument ``--ignore`` with comma separated violation codes
3. Configuration line inside ``setup.cfg``, `example <https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-python-styleguide/blob/master/setup.cfg#L23-L36>`_

You can ignore:

1. Whole ``WPS`` letters, this will completely turn off all our custom checks
2. Some specific group (naming, complexity, consistency, best practices, etc)
   with ``WPS`` and the first number of this group
3. Some specific violation with the full violation code

Use `per-file-ignores <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/options.html?highlight=per-file-ignores#cmdoption-flake8-per-file-ignores>`_
option, so it is possible to ignore violations on a per-file bases.
It means, that you can have different set of violations
ignored for different files.

Example:

.. code:: ini

  # Inside `setup.cfg`:
  [flake8]
  per-file-ignores =
    # There are multiple `assert`s in tests, we allow them:
    tests/*.py: S101
