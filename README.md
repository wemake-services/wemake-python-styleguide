Welcome to the most opinionated linter ever.

The main goal of this tool is to make our `python` code
consistent and to fight the code complexity.

`wemake-python-styleguide` is actually `flake8` plugin
with some other plugins as dependencies.

```text
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```


## Installation

```bash
pip install wemake-python-styleguide
```


## Project status

We are almost ready for our first public release.
Until, use it on your own risk.


## What we are not

We are here not to:

1. Assume or check types, use `mypy` instead
2. Reformat code, since we believe that developers should do that
3. Check for `SyntaxError`s or exceptions, write tests instead
4. Suite everyone, this is *our* linter
