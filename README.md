Welcome to the strictest and most opinionated python linter ever.

       alt="wemake-python-styleguide logo">
</p>

`wemake-python-styleguide` is actually a [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
plugin with [some other plugins](https://wemake-python-styleguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/violations/index.html#external-plugins) as dependencies.

## Installation

```bash
pip install wemake-python-styleguide
```

You will also need to create a `setup.cfg` file with [the following contents](https://wemake-python-styleguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/options/config.html#plugins).

This file is required to configure our linter and all 3rd party plugins it uses.
However, this is a temporary solution.
We are working at providing the required configuration for you in the future.


## Running

```bash
flake8 your_module.py
```

This app is still just good old `flake8`!
And it won't change your existing workflow.

See ["Usage" section](https://wemake-python-styleguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/usage/setup.html)
in the docs for examples and integrations.


## What we are about

The ultimate goal of this project is
to make all people write **exactly** the same `python` code.

|                            | black | pylint | flake8 | wemake-python-styleguide |
|----------------------------|-------|--------|--------|--------------------------|
| Formats code?              |   ‚úÖ   |    ‚ùå   |    ‚ùå   |             ‚ùå            |
| Finds bugs?                |   ‚ùå   |    ‚úÖ   |    ü§î   |             ‚úÖ            |
| Finds complex code?        |   ‚ùå   |    ‚úÖ   |    ü§î   |             ‚úÖ            |
| Has a lot of strict rules? |   ‚ùå   |    ü§î   |    ‚ùå   |             ‚úÖ            |
| Has a lot of plugins?      |   ‚ùå   |    ‚ùå   |    ‚úÖ   |             ‚úÖ            |

We have several primary objectives:

0. Enforce `python3.6+` usage
1. Significantly reduce complexity of your code and make it more maintainable
2. Enforce "There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it" rule to coding and naming styles
3. Protect developers from possible errors and enforce best practices

You can find all error codes and plugins [in the docs](https://wemake-python-styleguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/violations/index.html).


## What we are not

We are *not* planning to do the following things:

0. Assume or check types, use `mypy` instead
1. Reformat code, since we believe that developers should do that
2. Check for `SyntaxError` or logical bugs, write tests instead
3. Appeal to everyone. But, you can [switch off](https://wemake-python-styleguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/usage/setup.html#ignoring-violations) any rules that you don't like
