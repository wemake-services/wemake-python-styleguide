Welcome to the strictest and most opinionated python linter ever.

`wemake-python-styleguide` is actually a [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
plugin with [some other plugins](https://wemake-python-stylegui.de/en/latest/pages/usage/violations/index.html#external-plugins) as dependencies.


## Quickstart

```bash
pip install wemake-python-styleguide
```

You will also need to create a `setup.cfg` file with the [configuration](https://wemake-python-stylegui.de/en/latest/pages/usage/configuration.html).

We highly recommend to also use:

- [flakehell](https://wemake-python-stylegui.de/en/latest/pages/usage/integrations/flakehell.html) for easy integration into a **legacy** codebase
- [nitpick](https://wemake-python-stylegui.de/en/latest/pages/usage/integrations/nitpick.html) for sharing and validating configuration across multiple projects


## Running

```bash
flake8 your_module.py
```

This app is still just good old `flake8`!
And it won't change your existing workflow.

See ["Usage" section](https://wemake-python-stylegui.de/en/latest/pages/usage/setup.html)
in the docs for examples and integrations.

We also support [Github Actions](https://wemake-python-stylegui.de/en/latest/pages/usage/integrations/github-actions.html) as first class-citizens.

## What we are about

The ultimate goal of this project is
to make all people write **exactly** the same `python` code.

|                            | flake8 | pylint | black | mypy | wemake-python-styleguide |
|----------------------------|--------|--------|-------|------|--------------------------|
| Formats code?              |   ‚ùå   |   ‚ùå   |   ‚úÖ  |  ‚ùå  |            ‚ùå           |

We have several primary objectives:

0. Enforce `python3.6+` usage
1. Significantly reduce complexity of your code and make it more maintainable
2. Enforce "There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it" rule to coding and naming styles
3. Protect developers from possible errors and enforce best practices

You can find all error codes and plugins [in the docs](https://wemake-python-stylegui.de/en/latest/pages/usage/violations/index.html).


## What we are not

We are *not* planning to do the following things:

0. Assume or check types, use `mypy` together with our linter
1. [Reformat code](https://wemake-python-stylegui.de/en/latest/pages/usage/integrations/auto-formatters.html), since we believe that developers should do that
2. Check for `SyntaxError` or logical bugs, write tests instead
3. Appeal to everyone. But, you can [switch off](https://wemake-python-stylegui.de/en/latest/pages/usage/setup.html#ignoring-violations) any rules that you don't like


## Supporting us :tada:
